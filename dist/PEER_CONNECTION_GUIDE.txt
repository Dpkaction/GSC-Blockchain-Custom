GSC COIN PEER CONNECTION TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
==============================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
Two devices running gscvags.exe cannot connect to each other and don't show connected peers.

ROOT CAUSES FIXED:
1. ✅ Seed nodes were localhost IPs (won't work across devices)
2. ✅ No IP address display in GUI for manual connection
3. ✅ Improved peer discovery system
4. ✅ Enhanced network address detection

SOLUTION - USE gscvags_fixed.exe:
================================

The new gscvags_fixed.exe includes:
✅ Better IP address detection
✅ Network address display in GUI
✅ Improved peer connectivity
✅ Manual connection capabilities
✅ Real-time network status

HOW TO CONNECT TWO DEVICES:
===========================

STEP 1: Get Your Network Information
-----------------------------------
1. Run gscvags_fixed.exe on Device A
2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Look for "Connection Information" section
4. Note your IP Address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
5. Note your P2P Address (e.g., 192.168.1.100:8333)

STEP 2: Share Your P2P Address
-----------------------------
1. Copy your P2P Address using the "Copy" button
2. Share it with the other device user
   - Via text message, email, or verbally
   - Example: "My P2P Address is 192.168.1.100:8333"

STEP 3: Connect Manually
-----------------------
On Device B:
1. Run gscvags_fixed.exe
2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Find "Manual Connect" section
4. Enter Device A's IP address: 192.168.1.100
5. Enter Port: 8333
6. Click "Connect to Peer"

STEP 4: Verify Connection
------------------------
Both devices should now show:
- Connected Peers: 1 (or more)
- Network Status: 🟢 Connected
- Peer listed in "Connected Peers" section

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

If connection fails:

1. CHECK NETWORK:
   - Both devices on same WiFi network?
   - Same subnet (192.168.1.x or 192.168.0.x)?

2. CHECK FIREWALL:
   - Windows Firewall may block port 8333
   - Allow gscvags_fixed.exe through firewall
   - Or temporarily disable firewall for testing

3. CHECK IP ADDRESSES:
   - Use correct IP from "Connection Information"
   - Don't use 127.0.0.1 (localhost only)
   - Use actual network IP (192.168.x.x)

4. CHECK PORT:
   - Default P2P port is 8333
   - Make sure port is not used by other apps

5. RESTART IF NEEDED:
   - Close and restart gscvags_fixed.exe
   - Try connecting from both directions

NETWORK REQUIREMENTS:
====================
- Same local network (WiFi/Ethernet)
- Port 8333 available
- Windows Firewall configured
- Valid network IP addresses

RPC CONNECTIVITY:
================
- RPC Server runs on port 8332
- RPC Address shown in Connection Information
- Use for external integrations
- Example: http://192.168.1.100:8332

TESTING TRANSACTION BROADCASTING:
================================
Once connected:
1. Send a transaction on Device A
2. Check mempool on Device B
3. Transaction should appear automatically
4. Start mining on either device
5. Mined block broadcasts to both

ADVANCED TROUBLESHOOTING:
========================

Windows Firewall Fix:
1. Windows Security → Firewall & network protection
2. Allow an app through firewall
3. Add gscvags_fixed.exe to exceptions
4. Allow for both Private and Public networks

Network Discovery:
1. If manual connection fails
2. Try connecting from both directions
3. Check Windows network discovery settings
4. Ensure network profile is "Private" not "Public"

Port Testing:
1. Use telnet to test port connectivity
2. telnet [IP_ADDRESS] 8333
3. Should connect if port is open

WHAT'S FIXED IN gscvags_fixed.exe:
=================================
✅ Removed non-working seed nodes
✅ Added network address display in GUI
✅ Improved IP address detection
✅ Enhanced peer discovery system
✅ Better error handling for connections
✅ Real-time network status updates
✅ Copy buttons for easy address sharing

SUCCESS INDICATORS:
==================
When working correctly, you'll see:
- 🟢 Connected status in Network tab
- Peer count > 0
- Peer IP addresses listed
- Transactions sync between devices
- Blocks broadcast automatically
- Shared mempool across devices

For additional support, check the network logs in the GUI console tab.
